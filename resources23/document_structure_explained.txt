document bad structure
- forms contain a sub-document, of which each key contains another sub-document with a single property, status. 
- This is difficult to traverse as your forms element has an arbitrary structure for each document you create
    1st form has these properties ===> PreOp, Alert, City, Country
    2nd form has these properties ===> Journey, Women, Child, Farm
- the 2nd element changes all the time
    Forms -> PreOp -> status
    Forms -> Alert -> status
- difficult/complex to query

document good structure
- document structure where you can traverse in a standard pattern
